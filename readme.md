# FindRecipe Web Application

This web application, allows users to search for recipes by inputting ingredients. We set up three categories: meat, vegetable, and fruit. That they list out common ingredients for each category.
Users can select or unselect the ingredients by checking or unchecking the checkbox. Whenever they check or uncheck an ingredient, the ingredients will reflect in the container below that indicates they select or unselect.
In the meantime, if the ingredient that the user wants to select is not on the list. Users can enter that in the search bar and the ingredient with a checkbox will also be in the container below. That checkbox is to allow users to unselect entered ingredients if they want to.
After the user selected all the ingredients, the application will generate a list of recipes by clicking the Find a Recipe button.
